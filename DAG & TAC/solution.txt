1. DAG ARRAY::

  a. I used a STL named unordered_map. 
  b. Here tempalates are a String as the key and a DAG_Node* as the value.
  c. The key String contains label of a Node and its right child and left child so that it can be unique for once.
  d. In constructNode function , firstly I made the key String then searched in the map.
  e. If it is not in the map, I created a temporary Node of DAG_Node and made its index equals to currIndex. Then pushed that node in the  dag_array corresponding to currIndex.
  f. Else I simply returned that index of a Node corresponding to the key value.
  g. After creating dag_array, I wrote the construct_tac() function.
